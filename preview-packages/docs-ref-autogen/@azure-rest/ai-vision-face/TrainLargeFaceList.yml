      Training is a crucial step that only a trained Large Face List can be used
      by "Find Similar From Large Face List".


      The training task is an asynchronous task. Training time depends on the
      number of face entries in a Large Face List. It could be in seconds, or up
      to half an hour for 1,000,000 faces. To check training completion, please
      use "Get Large Face List Training Status".
