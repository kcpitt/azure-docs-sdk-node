      Depending on the input the returned similar faces list contains faceIds or
      persistedFaceIds ranked by similarity.


      Find similar has two working modes, "matchPerson" and "matchFace".
      "matchPerson" is the default mode that it tries to find faces of the same
      person as possible by using internal same-person thresholds. It is useful
      to find a known person's other photos. Note that an empty list will be
      returned if no faces pass the internal thresholds. "matchFace" mode
      ignores same-person thresholds and returns ranked similar faces anyway,
      even the similarity is low. It can be used in the cases like searching
      celebrity-looking faces.


      The 'recognitionModel' associated with the query faceId should be the same
      as the 'recognitionModel' used by the target Face List.
