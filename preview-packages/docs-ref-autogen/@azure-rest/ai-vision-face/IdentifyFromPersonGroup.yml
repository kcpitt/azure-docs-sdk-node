      For each face in the faceIds array, Face Identify will compute
      similarities between the query face and all the faces in the Dynamic
      Person Group (given by dynamicPersonGroupId), and return candidate
      person(s) for that face ranked by similarity confidence.

      > [!NOTE]

      >

      > *

      >   * The algorithm allows more than one face to be identified
      independently at the same request, but no more than 10 faces.

      >   * Each person could have more than one face, but no more than 248
      faces.

      >   * Higher face image quality means better identification precision.
      Please consider high-quality faces: frontal, clear, and face size is
      200x200 pixels (100 pixels between eyes) or bigger.

      >   * Number of candidates returned is restricted by
      maxNumOfCandidatesReturned and confidenceThreshold. If no person is
      identified, the returned candidates will be an empty array.

      >   * The Identify operation can only match faces obtained with the same
      recognition model, that is associated with the query faces.
